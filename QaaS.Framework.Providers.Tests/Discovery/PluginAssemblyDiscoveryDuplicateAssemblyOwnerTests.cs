/// Adversarial: when two RuntimeLibrary entries each emit a runtime assembly with the
/// same simple name as the contract anchor, only the *first* library is recorded as the
/// owner (libraryOwningAssembly uses TryAdd). The reverse-walk therefore starts from a
/// single seed and silently drops the entire subgraph of dependents that hang off the
/// second library.
///
/// Real-world trigger: a plugin host that ships the contract anchor next to an SDK
/// metapackage which also re-exposes the contract assembly under the same simple name
/// (think `Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces` style polyfills, or a contract assembly that
/// is split across a primary package and a back-compat shim package). NuGet does not
/// forbid two packages from publishing the same simple-named DLL.
